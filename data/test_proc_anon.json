I've been doing a lot of thinking, lately, and I think I've finally got a handle on why the pandemic has been so chronically stressful for me, and others, over the past year. Specifically those in first world countries, in relation to how it affects us on a psychological level. As people, we tend to experience bad things as happening suddenly, all at once, and then you deal with them. A broken leg, a car wreak, getting fired, getting dumped, etc. Deeply unpleasant, but relatively short-duration things. These are type-1 and type-2 problems; Things which can be avoided, or which can be fixed. But the Coronavirus has loaded us all down with the third type of problem. The kind that just needs to be coped with, and waited out, against which you can do basically nothing except endure. And... we are really, really bad at just holding tight and doing nothing. Especially since the pandemic has stripped us of most of our usual coping mechanisms. Our comfortable distractions, eating out with friends, seeing a movie, big events and holidays to look forward to. That's been the truly soul-crushing part. Lots of us weren't doing too great before the pandemic hit, but then, after 15 months of slow, grinding lockdowns, endless bad news on top of bad news, and nowhere to go to get away from it... Is it really a wonder why everyone is so unhappy all the time? I feel like a machine that's trying harder and harder to run without lubricant, to the point that it's just scraping metal-on-metal, and every day is a bit harder than the last. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to keep this up. The possibility of a variant wave in the Fall, forcing us back into yet another lockdown, terrifies me. I can't relax, I can't focus, and it's been seven or eight months since I've had any meaningful hope for the future. This late in the game, I just... can't shake the feeling that things will never get better. 2019 was the best things will ever be in my lifetime, and it's all downhill from here.": [[[13], "Lots of us weren't doing too great before the pandemic hit, but then, after 15 months of slow, grinding lockdowns, endless bad news on top of bad news, and nowhere to go to get away from it...

Just looking at the situation over there, it's making me fear the same could happen at my university. My university has been very restrictive throughout 2020-2021, but seems to have changed stance coming into this semester accepting Covid is something we have to learn to coexist with.

We don't have surveillance testing here, and one could say that's bad, but I think this helped us avert something similar this semester. My university is huge, so if we had similar testing as Cornell, I'm afraid we'd have detected a similar outbreak and gone remote.

I honestly feel bad for Cornell students right now after having yet another semester upended by Covid, and who knows about Spring 2022. Even worse, I now have an ominous feeling that the shitshow at Cornell will soon come to my university and we'd see the same thing happen. Is this a preview of what's to come at my university? Is this a preview of the damage Omicron can do? I saw that the Cornell president sent out an email saying why even if a variant is more mild, if it's more transmissible the impact will be more serious, using this to defend the university's decision to close down. Their libraries are closed, dining halls are closed, and exams are moved online. It's the exact kind of nightmarish scenario that I wish would never happen at my university this year.

I feel like my mental health is going down the drain, but I just couldn't stop sometimes. The reason I couldn't stop sometimes is because I have this irrational fear that if I stopped, I'd just be putting my head in the sand and falling into a delusional slumber, and I won't be \"awake\" to the threat on the horizon.

Because of this, I'm deciding that a better approach may be to just refer to well-established experts in order to stay up to date on Covid. It's honestly a win-win. I'm not putting my head in the sand, but neither am I doomscrolling and destroying my mental health.

Add that to all the Israelis who have attained natural immunity from the virus, and the percentage rate of immunity within Israel arrives at roughly 66%. For a group to have herd immunity to COVID-19, 70% must be immune. Because Israel has yet to achieve herd immunity, it is still possible for an outbreak to take place.

According to graphs in Scotland, the variant may hit hard and fast, but it ultimately doesn't do as bad a damage as other variants. In fact, Scotland's cases peaked at June 30 after having a big spike. But now the cases have since crashed. Big time. More importantly, the hospitalization's peak, two weeks after, topped out at 1/4 that of Alpha. Again, most of that has to do with how vaccinated Scotland was. More interestingly, the most vaccinated regions didn't have such a major impact with it and barely had any huge numbers. The unvaccinated ones, on the other hand, did. What does all this mean?

They stayed for 2 days at my sisters house while we did some Christmas shopping this weekend. Sister and her husband are fully vaccinated also. Sister calls Sunday evening to tell me that her husband can't smell or taste. I immediately go get the kids and bring them home. They get tested. She's negative he's positive like we assumed. Monday night the 2 older kids start coughing with no fever. Tuesday they feel like crap so I go get some rapid tests from Walmart. Sure enough they're positive. The 5 year old is completely fine. No symptoms and negative test. As with me and my wife. Right now the 10 year old is getting hit the hardest with fever. We've been rotating Tylenol and motrin every 3 to 4 hours per her pediatrician and she's still coughing quite a bit and saying her belly is hurting some.

They're really good kids and decided it would be best if they quarantined to their room and wore a mask when they had to come out so they don't get their little sister sick. I've struggled this entire pandemic to keep their lives as normal as possible while still trying to keep them safe and I'm feeling like a massive failure right now.

Having COVID has honestly traumatised me and it's made me very confused on what to do. The irony is not lost on me though that I got it from the vaccination site. I was due to have my 2nd dose a couple of weeks ago, however, I missed it because I was still recovering from lingering symptoms. Now that I'm feeling better, I was supposed to go get it but one of my doctors told me to defer it. Honestly, he doesn't seem to trust the brand I got and suggested I wait for the availability of another (which is my preferred brand). To be completely honest, I would wait for my preferred brand but I'm also terrified of the Delta variant that's expected to surge where I live. But I'm also terrified of going back to the vaccination site (it's very PTSD for me). I feel trapped and I feel like whatever decision I make, something bad will happen. I'm so confused. Please do let me know your thoughts but be kind and understanding. Thank you.": [[[2], "Just a background: I'm NOT an anti-vaxxer but these are the circumstances that force me to ask myself this question."]], "Im terrified. I dont feel protected by my vaccination. Would getting COVID kill me? Almost definitely not. Will I end up in the hospital? Probably not. Will I get a mild or asymptomatic infection that leads to long-haul symptoms I have to deal with for months if not even longer? No one knows, and the doctors dont seem to care. All the focus has been on survival, and they dont care about quality of life afterwards. Im not sure that I want to survive if I couldnt smell or taste ever again and I had neurological problems and stuff. Meanwhile, all of my vaccinated (I hope/assume) friends have decided that the pandemic is over now, and I feel like I have to choose between protecting my health or everybody moving on without me. Im in improv comedy, and all the theaters are plowing ahead with unmasked performances in little rooms with low ventilation, and a month ago, I would have been excited, but the delta variant (and the gamma, which is also in Chicago for some fucking reason) has changed my risk tolerance.

Ok, so this will be a bit long maybe. So, today our State Goverment announced that they received 134,400 doses of vaccines for the City Metropolitan area, for people of age 30 to 39 (Total population of the urban area: around 5.35 million). However, the issue is: the vaccine the federal goverment is sending is Sinovac (Previously they where sending <ORG> and <PERSON>, and for the teachers they send Cansino). Unfortunately while searching for information, i got the data that the efficiency of Sinovac is barely above 50% And IDK what to think or to do. IMO the best is efficiency above 70% that most vaccines get. This would mean that if i got Sinovac, I will still need to keep isolated for a longer time and i'm getting extremely tired for that.

I've been doing a lot of thinking, lately, and I think I've finally got a handle on why the pandemic has been so chronically stressful for me, and others, over the past year.

A broken leg, a car wreak, getting fired, getting dumped, etc. Deeply unpleasant, but relatively short-duration things. These are type-1 and type-2 problems; Things which can be avoided, or which can be fixed. But the Coronavirus has loaded us all down with the third type of problem. The kind that just needs to be coped with, and waited out, against which you can do basically nothing except endure. And... we are really, really bad at just holding tight and doing nothing. Especially since the pandemic has stripped us of most of our usual coping mechanisms. Our comfortable distractions, eating out with friends, seeing a movie, big events and holidays to look forward to. That's been the truly soul-crushing part. Lots of us weren't doing too great before the pandemic hit, but then, after 15 months of slow, grinding lockdowns, endless bad news on top of bad news, and nowhere to go to get away from it...

Since March 2020, I've been in a COVID bubble with my wife, sister-in-law, and their parents. While the last year and a half have been trying emotionally and professionally for all of us, things are looking up with the vaccine. However, my wife's parents refuse to get vaccinated. They are not in great health and my father-in-law specifically is older and I worry about his health. Therefore, even as things have started to open up, my family has been relatively more conservative, with no masks-free indoor interaction outside of the family, even with people that are vaccinated, for fear of spreading the virus to my inlaws. This is becoming a big problem because I am building a startup and my cofounder is someone I met during the pandemic. He and I need to start building a more regular working cadence and relationship, but this is really difficult since my wife and SIL are not comfortable with me working in person with him, even though he is vaccinated (though he is much less careful than us). For my part, I would like to push the company forward, and agree that our creative work would improve if we were able to work in-person a couple of times per week.

This was just never even really a threat to him, now he has myocarditis from it, and oh, he probably will still be susceptible to omicron anyways. I am struggling to find literature or accurate discussions on the risks of myocarditis vs COVID in young adults, which is frustrating as it feels like you are shamed for even asking if any of the risks are worth it for young people.

I think I'm done with my boosters for the next couple years. Unless they develop one that is going to actually protect against variants and not allow you to spread the virus, I'm just so disillusioned with how ineffective they truly are. Yeah, I get that they still prevent \"death and hospitalization\", but the fact that you can still catch the virus, spread the virus, get not-mild \"mild\" symptoms from the virus, and need to socially distance, mask, isolate is depressing.

And that as covid continues to spread among the unvaccinated, it would bring us closer to herd immunity through natural infections. However, whenever I see this argument, I start to doubt if natural immunity could actually be of any help. And this concern is due to one thing: variants. From what I've heard, natural immunity doesn't protect as well against some variants, such as Delta. They could still be reinfected with Delta even if they had a prior infection from the original strain. Not sure how common this is, though, and I've heard that natural immunity can still protect against Delta, so I'm taking this with a grain of salt. However, given the progressively worse variants we've witnessed over the past few months (first B.1.1.7, and now Delta), I often worry about the following possibility: 1. COVID spreads like wildfire among the unvaccinated 2. Because it's spreading like wildfire, a new variant emerges 3. This hypothetical variant is even worse than the last, and can reinfect you even if you've had prior infection from previous strains. 4. This new variant goes to reinfect those who have been infected with previous strains, and spreads like wildfire among them. 5. Rinse and repeat It is this thought that often makes it difficult to see that all pandemics end eventually, usually after a few years. It makes me worried that if we go the natural immunity route, we will just be stuck in this perpetual cycle with each iteration producing a worse variant, as long as there are large numbers of unvaccinated people.

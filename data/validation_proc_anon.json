He was the kindest and purest human being. I met him briefly yesterday as we took him to the hospital. Today he passed away from COVID, he was deathly afraid from needles and the vaccination. I feel so so powerless. So guilty I didnt reply to his phone call 3 days earlier as my family was also sick of Covid and I was caring for them. The death feels like it could have been avoided, he took the remaining precautions but it didnt work. At least he died happy alongside his family in his hometown where I live. I dont know what or how to live life without him in my mind, without meeting him ever again, with seeing the same places without him. Im tired, I want to cry.

Masks with filters, hand sanitizer obsessively. Avoid my partner for a week once I get back, masking whenever in common areas. If anyone gives me grief about masking, just tell them \"Hi, for context: I'm halfway through a 16-hour roadtrip to help my mom pick out my dad's headstone. What was it you needed to tell me?\" (I'm autistic. Scripts are good.) Is this too risky? I can still cancel the hotel and rebook later. Antsy skippable backstory: I totally blame my mom for killing my dad. She brought Covid home after attending a \"mandatory work Christmas breakfast party\". My dad was definitely vulnerable to the disease, having a history of heart problems. I'm still very very upset and pissed at her. She's a narcissist that's been playing the \"grieving widow\" card since before my dad died.

I've read about different forms \"long Covid\" takes - it's not always persistent - some report reinfection or reactivation of Covid after periods of dormancy. Two weeks after my initial reactivation, my symptoms begin to subside. I decide to get the first Covid vaccine (I read that in some \"vaccine vanguard\" countries like Israel, they were recommending one covid shot for those who had already had the virus). I get the first shot, and feel a little not great for about 48 hours or so (mild discomfort in lymph nodes, some fatigue, weakness), but afterwards I begin to feel great, better than I had at any point since before I got Covid in early May. A week ago I put in a full exercise. About 24 hours later, I don't feel like I felt when I had Covid, but I definitely feel the exact same as I did *after* I had gotten my first shot - mild discomfort in lymph nodes, some weakness. I am under the impression working out a second time \"reactivated\" dormant Covid, but the vaccine kicked back in and enlisted my immune system in fighting this second activation. Finding information about the virus at this time has been so frustrating - official counsel has lagged internet anecdotes and similar by a considerable amount of time.

And that as covid continues to spread among the unvaccinated, it would bring us closer to herd immunity through natural infections. However, whenever I see this argument, I start to doubt if natural immunity could actually be of any help. And this concern is due to one thing: variants. From what I've heard, natural immunity doesn't protect as well against some variants, such as Delta. They could still be reinfected with Delta even if they had a prior infection from the original strain. Not sure how common this is, though, and I've heard that natural immunity can still protect against Delta, so I'm taking this with a grain of salt. However, given the progressively worse variants we've witnessed over the past few months (first B.1.1.7, and now Delta), I often worry about the following possibility: 1. COVID spreads like wildfire among the unvaccinated 2. Because it's spreading like wildfire, a new variant emerges 3. This hypothetical variant is even worse than the last, and can reinfect you even if you've had prior infection from previous strains. 4. This new variant goes to reinfect those who have been infected with previous strains, and spreads like wildfire among them. 5. Rinse and repeat It is this thought that often makes it difficult to see that all pandemics end eventually, usually after a few years. It makes me worried that if we go the natural immunity route, we will just be stuck in this perpetual cycle with each iteration producing a worse variant, as long as there are large numbers of unvaccinated people.

In fact, Scotland's cases peaked at June 30 after having a big spike. But now the cases have since crashed. Big time.

One, it means that perhaps the Delta Variant wave won't be as long or as massively damaging as some people are fearing, and two, the vaccine helps. Again, the more we vaccinate, the faster we'll be out of this. But having said that, the Delta Variant's wave thankfully may not be as lengthy.

I have lost over 60 pounds in the last few months and am going strong with weight loss and healthier eating/daily exercise. But my weight being so high is still clearly putting me at higher risk. Additionally I have been diagnosed with fatty liver disease that is an additional risk factor, especially combined with obesity. I have been attempting to get healthier to address both of these concerns but I am scared that this will not be enough and catching COVID could kill me. I have had an overwhelming feeling of impending doom. Does anyone have any advice on how to cope with this anxiety/ have any perspective on this situation?

I know individual levels can vary and that we still don't know what antibody levels = immunity, but it would still be interested to know the common ranges seen after vaccination.

By 12/27 I had a full-blown sore throat, fever, chills, &amp; difficulty breathing. Standing to do dishes became impossible.

I'd like to ask them how they are not afraid, but I'm ashamed to reveal to them that I'm so weak mentally. I'm also afraid of being offended that they would downplay my anxiety.
